//What is the area of a rectangle given
// that half of the width is 17.5 sq ft
// and the height is double of its true value which is 84 sq ft

//A = W * H This is the formula to calculate the area.
//

var width = 17.5 * 2; //Multiply by 2 since we only have half of the width
console.log(width); //Width

var height = 84 / 2; //Divide by 2 since we got double of the actual height
console.log(height); //Height
