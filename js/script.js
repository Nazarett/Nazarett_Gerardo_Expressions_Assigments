//What is the area of a rectangle given
// that half of the width is 17.5 sq ft
// and the height is double of its true value which is 84 sq ft

//A = W * H This is the formula to calculate the area.

var width = 17.5 * 2; //Multiply by 2 since we only have half of the width

var height = 84 / 2; //Divide by 2 since we got double of the actual height
console.log(height + " Sq Ft "); //Height

var width = [15, 8, 23, 11, 6] //Different width
var height = [7, 12, 5, 21, 9]// Different height


var area0 = width [0] * height [0]//Finding first area
console.log(area0) //First area

var area1 = width [1] * height [1] //Finding second

var area2 = width [2] * height [2] //Finding third area
console.log(area2) //Third area

var area3 = width [3] * height [3] //Finding fourth area
